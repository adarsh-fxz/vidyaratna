# Linux Kernel Development

This is a comprehensive resource guide for getting into Linux Kernel development. It is structured in phases, from building foundational knowledge to contributing patches to the kernel, with practical resources and tips along the way.

## Phase 1: Understand Operating Systems and the Linux Kernel

Before diving into actual development, it's good to have a solid understanding of Operating Systems and the Linux Kernel, its structure, and the ecosystem around it.

### Key Concepts to Learn

- **Operating Systems**: Learn the basics, including processes, memory management, and filesystems.
- **C Programming**: The Linux Kernel is written in C, so proficiency in C is essential.
- **Linux Command Line**: Learn how to navigate, compile, and troubleshoot in the terminal. This can be developed easily by simply using a Linux Distro as your daily driver.

## Phase 2: Setup the Development Environment

Having a proper development setup is essential. You’ll need to be comfortable with compiling, testing, and debugging kernels.

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Set Up a Kernel Development Environment**:
   - Use QEMU or VirtualBox to run and test your custom-built kernels in a VM.
   - Consider using [virtme-ng](https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng) for faster build times.

2. **Build and Boot a Custom Kernel**:
   - Build the official kernel from source, which can be found on [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/).
   - Boot the custom kernel in a VM or on a test system to understand the build and boot process.

3. **Learn Git**: All Linux kernel development happens via Git. Learn git basics and how to create, format, and submit patches.

## Phase 3: Start Contributing to the Linux Kernel

At this stage, you should be ready to make your first small contributions to the Linux kernel.

### Find Your First Patch:

1. **Explore Kernel Bug Trackers**:
   - Check [Bugzilla for the Linux Kernel](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/) for beginner-friendly bugs to fix.

2. **Attend Linux Foundation Mentorship Programs**:
   - The [Linux Foundation Live Mentorship Series](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lf-live-mentorship-series/) offers an entryway to Linux kernel projects with experienced mentors.

3. **Read Kernel Mailing Lists (LKML)**:
  - Subscribing and reading discussions on LKML will help you learn from others and understand the kernel’s patch submission process.

4. **Kernel Newbies’ List of Small Tasks**: Focus on [small tasks](https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch) to gain initial experience.

### How to Submit Patches:

Once you've identified a small bug or improvement, the next step is to submit your first patch.

1. **Follow the Linux Kernel Patch Submission Process**:
   - Learn how to use `git format-patch` and `git send-email` to format your patches correctly.
   - Follow the **kernel coding style guidelines** (`scripts/checkpatch.pl` can help check your code).

2. **Use Mailing Lists**: 
   - Submit patches to the appropriate kernel mailing list and be prepared to respond to feedback.
